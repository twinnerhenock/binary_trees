# binary trees
This is a 4-day project on Binary Trees with c.

# Tasks
* New node
	* <a href="0-binary_tree_node.c">0-binary_tree_node.c </a> Create a function that creates a binary node with a given parent and value. 
	* Returns a pointer to the new node or NULL on failure.

* Insert Node
	* <a href="2-binary_tree_insert_right.c">2-binary_tree_insert_right.c </a> Inserts a node as the right-child of another.
	* Returns a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure.
	* If the given parent already contains a right node, the new node takes its place and the old right-child becomes the right of the new node.

* Delete Node
	* <a href="3-binary_tree_delete.c">3-binary_tree_delete.c</a> Function deletes an entire binary tree.

* Is leaf
	* <a href="4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c">4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c</a> Function that checks if a given node is a leaf.
	* Returns 1 if the node is a leaf, o otherwise.

* Is root
	* <a href="5-binary_tree_is_root.c">5-binary_tree_is_root.c</a> Function that checks if a given node is a root.
	* Returns 1 if the node is a root, 0 otherwise.

* Pre-order traversal
	* <a href="6-binary_tree_preorder.c">6-binary_tree_preorder.c</a> function that traverses a tree using pre-order traversal.

* In-order traversal <a href="7-binary_tree_inorder.c">7-binary_tree_inorder.c</a> function that traverses a tree using in-order traversal.

* Post-order traversal <a href="8-binary_tree_postorder.c">8-binary_tree_postorder.c</a> function that traverses a tree using post-order traversal.

* Height <a href="9-binary_tree_height.c">9-binary_tree_height.c</a> function that returns the height of a tree.

* Depth <a href="10-binary_tree_depth.c">10-binary_tree_depth.c</a> function that returns the depth of a tree.

* Size <a href="11-binary_tree_size.c">11-binary_tree_size.c</a> function that returns the size of a tree.

* Leaves <a href="12-binary_tree_leaves.c">12-binary_tree_leaves.c</a> function that returns the number of leaves of a tree.

* Nodes <a href="13-binary_tree_nodes.c">13-binary_tree_nodes.c</a> function that returns the number of nodes of a tree with atleast one child.

* Balance factor <a href="14-binary_tree_balance.c">14-binary_tree_balance.c</a> function that returns the balance factor of a tree.

* Is full <a href="15-binary_tree_is_full.c">15-binary_tree_is_full.c</a> function that checks if a binary tree is full.
	* Returns 1 if a tree is full, 0 otherwise.

* Is perfect <a href="16-binary_tree_is perfect.c">16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c</a> function that checks if a tree is perfect.
	* Returns NULL if no sibling is found.

* Sibling <a href="17-binary_tree_sibling.c">17-binary_tree_sibling.c</a> function that returns a pointer to the sibling of a given node of a tree.
	* Returns NULL if no uncle is found.

* Uncle <a href="18-binary_tree_uncle.c">18-binary_tree_uncle.c</a> function that returns pointer to the uncle of a given node in a tree.
